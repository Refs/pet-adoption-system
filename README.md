# Pet Adoption System
This is the sample project for the Auth0 blog post [Create Your First Custom Schematic with Nx](http://www.auth0.com/blog/create-custom-schematics-with-nx/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx). Both the Angular CLI and Nx are version 7+.

## Quick Start & Documentation

[Watch a 5-minute video on how to get started with Nx.](http://nrwl.io/nx)

## Generate your first application

Run `ng generate app myapp` to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace. Read more [here](http://nrwl.io/nx).

## Development server

Run `ng serve --project=myapp` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project=myapp` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --project=myapp` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Using Auth0 for Authentication
We recommend using [Auth0](https://auth0.com) to manage authentication for this project.

### Sign Up for Auth0
You'll first need to sign up for an [Auth0](https://auth0.com) account. You can <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up for a free Auth0 account here</a>.

### Set Up an Application
Once you've got your account, you can set up an application to use with this project. We'll set up a Single Page Application (SPA) in Auth0 in these steps.

Here's how to set that up:

1. Go to your [**Auth0 Applications**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and click the "Create Application" button.
2. Name your new app, select "Single Page Web Applications," and click the "Create" button. You can skip the Quick Start and click on **Settings**.
3. In the **Settings** for your new Auth0 app, add `http://localhost:4200/callback` to the **Allowed Callback URLs**. (We're using `localhost:4200` since it's the default port for the Angular CLI `serve` command.)
4. Add `http://localhost:4200` to the **Allowed Logout URLs**.
5. Click the "Save Changes" button.
6. Copy down your **Domain** and **Client ID**. We'll use them in just a minute.
7. If you'd like, you can [set up some social connections](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social). You can then enable them for your app in the **Application** options under the **Connections** tab. The example shown in the screenshot above utilizes username/password database, Facebook, Google, and Twitter.

> **Note:** Under the **OAuth** tab of **Advanced Settings** (at the bottom of the **Settings** section) you should see that the **JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm** is set to `RS256`. This is the default for new applications. If it is set to `HS256`, please change it to `RS256`. You can [read more about RS256 vs. HS256 JWT signing algorithms here](https://community.auth0.com/questions/6942/jwt-signing-algorithms-rs256-vs-hs256).

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
